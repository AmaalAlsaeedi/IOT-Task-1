ESP32 Operating Algorithm

To install the ESP32:

1. In Arduino IDE, go to File> Preferences.
2. Enter the following into the “Additional Board Manager URLs” field: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
3. Then, click the “OK” button.
4. Open the Boards Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager…
5. Search for ESP32 and press install button for the “ESP32 by Espressif Systems“.
6. it should be installed after a few seconds.
7. Plug the ESP32 board to the computer. With Arduino IDE open.
8. Select your Board in Tools > Board menu .
9. Select the Port.
10. Open File > Examples > WiFi (ESP32) > WiFiScan.
11. A new sketch opens in Arduino IDE.
12. Press the Upload button in the Arduino IDE. Wait a few seconds while the code compiles and uploads to your board.
13. If everything went as expected, you should see a “Done uploading.” message.
14. Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 115200.
15. Press the ESP32 on-board Enable button and you should see the networks available near your ESP32.
16. Press the “Upload” button in the Arduino IDE to upload your sketch.
17. After you see the “Connecting….” message in your Arduino IDE, release the finger from the “BOOT” button.
